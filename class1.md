#### Choosing a text-editor:

a Text-editor is a software that write and manages your text. and each  text-editor has its features but for the most part they are the same.

the default for MacOS is Text Edit and for Windows is Notepad.

There are some Third-Party options that are mostly free and include most    of features, like:

Sublime, Text-Wrangler, Notepad++, VSCode etc...

 

##### The Command Line / Basic Navigation / About Files:

A command line is a powerful tool that gives more options than the simple GUI that everyone is used to. I liked that we can open more than one terminal to do more than one process at a time.

Basic commands are like:

pwd: to print working directory.

ls: to list files.

cs: to change directory (navigate).

and so on.....

Just note that there are some rules you should be aware of, like the case sensitive rule, and be careful when you use spaces in names.
