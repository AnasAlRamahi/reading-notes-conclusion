### **HTML Chapter 4: Links**

* For writing links, we use the ``` <a> ``` element. It will provide us with alot of options:
    * Linking your website to another. You can also link pages within the same website with each other. It is done by using either an absolute or a relative URL.
    * Navigating to another part of the page. Or even navigating to a specific part of another page. This one relies on using id's and icluding them in the relative/absolute URL, using the \# and then the id of the element.
    * Start up email program with an email address in the "to" field.
    * Opens up a link in a new browser window. Even though it is a good practive, it's better to notify the user that the link open a new browser tab.


### **HTML Chapter 15: HTML Layout**
This chapter is pretty big, but in conclusion, it talks about how to position elements and how to make a layout for our html page. There are different ways to  position elements using normal flow, relative positioning, absolute positioning and floats. And we will be discussing more in depth in the later assignments about the layouts and the positioning of elements.


### **Javascript Chapter 3: Methods, Functions and Objects**

A **functoin** stores a block of code which gets executed when it's called. If you want to write the same block of code multiple times, you just have to write it as a function and call it each time with a single line instead. It can also be used to take different values and do the same procedure to then return different values, so it's not going to be returning the same values everytime it executes.
Such function will need values to be provided when calling the function. These are named in the declaratoin and are called parameters, but the values that are provided when calling the functions are called arguments.

Function can return a value. It can even return multiple values using arrays.

**Annonymous functoins** are functions that have no name, and therefore they aren't used multiple times withing the code.
Functoin Expression is an annonymous function that is stored inside a variable. These two kinds of functions can be used in different scenarios. 
* These scenarios can be concluded into :
    * As an argument when a function is called (to calculate a value for that function).
    * To assign the value of a property to an object.
    * In event handlers and listeners (see Chapter 6) to perform a task when an event occurs.
    * To prevent conflicts between two scripts that might use the same variable names.


### **Article : 6 Reasons For Pair Programming**

As we had insight about andragogy and how adults actually rely mostly on their experience, sharing this experience with others can be very benefitial for both sides, porgrammers work in paris and work on the code together. In ** Pair Programming**, one programmer is the **driver** and the other is the **Navigator**. This can improve their communication skills and inhance their teamowork. When 2 brains work on a problem, it's easier to solve. They might take a bit longer than a solo programmer, but they will produce a high quality code that might save some time in the future, when it doesn't cause problem and affect other code. So in conclusion, this is the benifits in **Pair Programming** :
+ Greater efficiency.
+ Engaged collaboration.
+ Learning from fellow students.
+ Socail skills.
+ Job interviews readiness.
+ Work environment readiness.
