### **Article: The Past, Present, and Future of Local Storage for Web Applications**
As users, when we are browsing over the internet, on some kind of a website, and we close the browser, everything that was put into the browser will be gone, and you will have to do the process all over again. Sometimes you need to keep some information locally, to keep the progress made on the website.

**Cookies** were made so long ago but they provide a really small storage which can reach mostly 4KB of data which is not efficient. *e.g: when you are playing a browser game and you closed the browser, the progress you made has to be saved.*

When HTML5 came out, it introduced something called **LocalStorage** or **DOM Storage**. Which stored data as key/value pairs in an object as a string, so when you want to retrieve any data, you should use *parseInt()* or *parseFloat()*. This object acts as a database that is accessed to save and retrieve data from the Javascript.
