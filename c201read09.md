### **HTML chapter 7: Forms**
To collect information from the user from the browser, we use the ``` <form> ``` element. It includes input elements inside (form controls), and when you submit the form, it sends the data to the server with the name of the input which you include as ``` name = ' something ' ``` attribute.

Forms have two attributes to use, first one is required and it is the ``` action = "url" ``` attribute, which takes the url of the server page that the data will be sent to. The other attribute is the ``` method = 'get or post' ```, which takes either get or post. The get value is used when the form is short and doesnt require adding or deleting data from the server. The post value is used when the form is too long or contains sensitive data or requires adding or deleting data form the server, amd it allows the user to upload files to be sent to the server.

There are alot of input types that you can use, such as:
* text
* password 
* textarea
* radio
* checkbox
* select
* file
* submit
* iamge
* button
* hidden
*These are available in HTML5 and will be treated as textlines in HTML4:*
* date
* email
* url
* search

``` <fieldset> ``` is used to gather the input elements together into one element. It uses an element called ``` <legend> ``` that includes a caption for the input group.
