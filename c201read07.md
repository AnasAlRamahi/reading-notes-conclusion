### **Domain Modeling:**
**Domain Modeling** s the process of creating a conceptual model for a specific problem. And a domain model that's articulated well can verify and validate your understanding of that problem.

Storing objects inside variables makes it accessible from the *outside*, and with ``` this. ```, it is accessible from the *inside*. Objects can have parameters to initialize the values of the properties from outside, so we can use the object for multiple instances, and that is called a constructor. To add methods to the object, you can write them inside the objcet, or you can use the *prototype*.


### **HTML Chapter 6: Tables**
Tables show data through double axis, which makes it more readable and accessible. In HTML, tables are drawn row by row. Inside each row there are a number of cells represented by the ```<td>``` element (or ```<th>``` if it is a header). You can split the table into ```<thead>```, ```<tbody>```, and ````<tfoot>```, to style them easily. And you can use the ```<th>``` for the first column. You may also use the colspan and rowspan attributes, to let a cell take a space of more than one cell vertically or horizontally.



### **JavaScript Chapter 3: Functions, Methods and Objects**
*Objects, using the constructor notation:*

The constructor notation for objects are used to initialize an object, giving it initial property values as arguments, which makes the objects more usable and saves alot of coding time. You write the object once, and then just call it with initial values form outside.
