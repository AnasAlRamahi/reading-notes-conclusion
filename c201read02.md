### **HTML Chapter 2: Text**
This chapter focuses on how to add markup to the text that appears on pages. You will learn about:

* **Structural markup**: the elements that you can use to describe both headings and paragraphs. Examples:
    * ``` <b> ```
    * ``` <i> ```
    * ``` <sup> ```
    * ``` <sub> ```
    * ``` <br /> ```
    * ``` <hr /> ```

* **Semantic markup**: which provides extra information; such as where emphasis is placed in a sentence, that somehting you have written is a quotation (and who siad it), the meaning of acronyms, and so on. Examples:
    * ``` <strong> ```
    * ``` <em> ```
    * ``` <blockquote> ```
    * ``` <q> ```
    * ``` <abbr> ```
    * ``` <cite> ```
    * ``` <dfn> ```
    * ``` <adress> ```
    * ``` <ins> ```
    * ``` <del> ```
    * ``` <s> ```


**HTML Chapter 10: Introducing CSS**
CSS treats each HTML element as if it appears inside its own box and uses rules to indicate how that element should look.
Rules are made up of selectors (that specify the elements the rule applies to) and declarations (that indicate what these elements should look like). Different types of selectors allow you to target your rules at different elements. There are different ways to include your CSS into your HTML page, inline, internal, and external file. External file for CSS is the best practice and the most practical.

Declarations are made up of two parts: the properties of the element that you want to change, and the values of those properties.



### **Javascript Chapter 2: Basic Javascript Instructions**
A **script** is made up of a series of statements. Each statement is like a step in a recipe. Scripts contain very precise instructions. For example,you might specify that a value must be remembered before creating a calculation using that value. Variables are used to temporarily store pieces of information used in the script. Arrays are special types of variables that store more than one piece of related information. 

JavaScript distinguishes between numbers (0-9), strings (text), and Boolean values (true or false). Expressions evaluate into a single value  Expressions rely on operators to calculate a value. 
There different kinds of operators: Arithmatic operators, Assignment operators, String operators, Comparison operators, and Logical Operators.

### **Javascript Chapter 4: Decisions and Loops**
There are often several places in a script where decisions are made that determine which lines of code should be run next. Flowcharts can help you plan for these occasions.

**Conditional statements** allow your code to make decisions about what to do next.

**Comparison operators** (===, ! ==, ==, ! =, <, >, <=, =>) are used to compare two operands. 

**Logical operators** allow you to combine more than one set of comparison operators. 

if ... else statements allow you to run one set of code if a condition is true, and another if it is false. 

**switch statements** allow you to compare a value against possible outcomes (and also provides a default option if none match). 
There are three types of **loop**: for, while, and do ... while. Each repeats a set of statements. If you know the number of iterations to happen, then use a for loop, but if you didn't, use a while loop. The do-while loop is a while loop that does the first iteration and then it tests the condition for the iterations after.
