### **HTML Chapter 2: Text**
This cahpter focuses on how to add markup to the text that appears on pages. You will learn about:
* **Structural markup**: the elements that you can use to describe both headings and paragraphs. Examples:
    * ``` <b> ```
    * ``` <i> ```
    * ``` <sup> ```
    * ``` <sub> ```
    * ``` <br /> ```
    * ``` <hr /> ```

* **Semantic markup**: which provides extra information; such as where emphasis is placed in a sentence, that somehting you have written is a quotation (and who siad it), the meaning of acronyms, and so on. Examples:
    * ``` <strong> ```
    * ``` <em> ```
    * ``` <blockquote> ```
    * ``` <q> ```
    * ``` <abbr> ```
    * ``` <cite> ```
    * ``` <dfn> ```
    * ``` <adress> ```
    * ``` <ins> ```
    * ``` <del> ```
    * ``` <s> ```


**HTML Chapter 10: Introducing CSS**
CSS treats each HTML element as if it appears inside its own box and uses rules to indicate how that element should look.
Rules are made up of selectors (that specify the elements the rule applies to) and declarations (that indicate what these elements should look like). Different types of selectors allow you to target your rules at different elements. There are different ways to include your CSS into your HTML page, inline, internal, and external file. External file for CSS is the best practice and the most practical.

Declarations are made up of two parts: the properties of the element that you want to change, and the values of those properties.
