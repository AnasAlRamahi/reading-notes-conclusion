### Comparison & Logical Operators :
**Comparison opertors** are used to evaluate the condition of an expression, to either result in true or false.

*Comparison Operators:*
*  ``` == ``` ___Equal to (checks the data only).
*  ``` === ``` __Strict equal to (checks the data and type).
*  ``` != ``` ___Not equal to (checks the data only).
*  ``` !== ``` __Strict not equal to (checks the data and type).
*  ``` > ``` ____Greater than.
*  ``` >= ``` ___Greater than or equal to.
*  ``` < ``` ____Less than.
*  ``` <= ``` ___Less than or equal to.

**Logical Operators** are used to compare the results of more than one comparison operator.

*Logical Operators:*
*  ``` && ``` ___AND (if the two expression are true then the result is true).
*  ``` || ``` ___OR (if one or more expression is true then the result is true).
*  ``` ! ``` ____NOT (reverses the expression).

### For & While loops :
Loops check a condition, if that condition resulted true, a block of code is run. Then it checks again and if the condition is still true, it will run the block again, it repeats until the condition is false.

*There are three types of loops that we can use :*
*  ``` For loops ``` (to run the code a specific number of times).
*  ``` While loops ``` (when you don't know how many iterations you need to meet theh intended conition).
*  ``` Do while loops ``` (same as the while loop but the first iteration is always executed, but after that it should meet the condition).
