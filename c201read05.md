### **HTML Chapter 5: Images**
Images can make the page much more interesting and informative, so picking the right image and putting it in the right place would be vital if you care about the pages' quality. There are three rules for creating images: **Save images in the right format**, **save them at the right size**, and **use the correct resolution**.

Picking the right format will save alot of space without effecting the quality of the page, each format is used in specific area, and the three most comon formats used are jpeg, png, and gif. 

Saving images at the right size is vital, you should save them at the same width and height it will appear on the website. In order not to be stretched or distorted. 

Resolution referes to the number of dots per inch, and most computer screens only show web pages at 72 ppi (pixel per inch). So saving them at a higher resolution will take more space for no benefit.


### **HTML Chapter 4: Color**
There are three ways to select a color in CSS: *RGB*, *HSL* and color name. As for the color name, you just have to write the color name to the attribute, there is 147 predefined colors that browsers can recognize. 


The term **RGB** refers to (red,green,blue). You just have to know the mixture of the colors, each color degree is between 0 and 255. There are lots of tools online that you can find to pick the right color, and get the rgb values. RGB color example :
* rgb(142,37,255)
*This will show color near to purple.*


**Hexa codes** are a hexadecimal code consisting of 6 hexadecimal degits. First two are for red, second two are for green and the last two are for blue. Here is an example :
* #F3FF1A
*This will show color near to yellow.*


As for the **HSL**, it stands for (hue, saturation, lightness).  The hue is the color degree, from 0 to 360. The saturation is the degree of grey that's in the color, it is written as a percentage. Lightness is the degree of white or black that's in the color. So if it was 0, then it's all black, and if it was 100%, then it's all white. And it also comes as a percentage. Here is an example :
* hsl(120,100,55)
*This will show color near to light-green*


You can also use the **Alpha** to control the opacity of the color. And it is available for both rgb and hsl. **RGBA** & **HSLA might** not be supported by some old browsers, so you can put another rule before them that is in rgb or in hsl, so the HTML can make a callback when the other color is not recognized.
* rgb(142,37,255)
*This will show color near to purple with high opacity.*
* hsl(120,100,55)
*This will show color near to light-green with low opacity.*


It is important to choose the right colors. When choosing a background, try to make some **contrast** between it's color, and the color of the text. Because text without contrast between the colors is not east to read, and it affects people that have issues with their eyes. But don't make the contrast too high, so the colors be so shiny and annoying to the human eye.


### **HTML Chapter 12: Text**


### Blog: JPEG vs PNG vs GIF

95% of images on the web are formatted with one of those 3 formats, **JPEG**, **PNG**, and **GIF**. Each one of them is used in a different scenario. **JPEG** is used for the natural scenaries or photorgraphs where variations in colors and intensity are smooth. **PNG** is able to show contrast for sharp edges, therefore it is used for logos, and images that have text in them. Unlike **JPEG**, **PNG** images support transparency, but it occupies more space on the disk.

**GIF** format, on the other hand, supports animations, JPEG and PNG don't. They are used mainly for images containing animatoins, and it takes the most space on the disk between these 3 formats.
