### Blog: JPEG vs PNG vs GIF

95% of images on the web are formatted with one of those 3 formats, **JPEG**, **PNG**, and **GIF**. Each one of them is used in a different scenario. **JPEG** is used for the natural scenaries or photorgraphs where variations in colors and intensity are smooth. **PNG** is able to show contrast for sharp edges, therefore it is used for logos, and images that have text in them. Unlike **JPEG**, **PNG** images support transparency, but it occupies more space on the disk.

**GIF** format, on the other hand, supports animations, JPEG and PNG don't. They are used mainly for images containing animatoins, and it takes the most space on the disk between these 3 formats.
