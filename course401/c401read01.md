## **Course 301: Read 14**


### **Java Basics:**
#### *Variables*
You've already learned that objects store their state in fields. However, the Java programming language also uses the term "variable" as well. This section discusses this relationship, plus variable naming rules and conventions, basic data types (primitive types, character strings, and arrays), default values, and literals.

#### *Operators*
This section describes the operators of the Java programming language. It presents the most commonly-used operators first, and the less commonly-used operators last. Each discussion includes code samples that you can compile and run.

#### *Expressions, Statements, and Blocks*
Operators may be used in building expressions, which compute values; expressions are the core components of statements; statements may be grouped into blocks. This section discusses expressions, statements, and blocks using example code that you've already seen.

#### *Control Flow Statements*
This section describes the control flow statements supported by the Java programming language. It covers the decisions-making, looping, and branching statements that enable your programs to conditionally execute particular blocks of code.


### **Reddit thread:**
#### **Does compiling mean to make the program executable?**
When you compile code, the compilor (usually another program) takes the program the human wrote, and converts it into the program the computer can understand (i.e. converts from Java to machine language). The very short version could be, yes, compile means to make the code executable.

Something you may run into is people saying code does or does not compile. This means the compilor they used checks to make sure their program is written correctly according to the rules of the programming language.
It's also important to note that just because the code compiles doesn't mean it works. It's sort of like how 3 + 4 < 5 is an equation that has the right form, but it is incorrect.

### **Making Sense of Java’s API Documentation:**
By Barry Burd
Java has a whole collection of grammatical features, but Java is much more than just a big set of grammar rules. Java has a standard Application Programming Interface —a huge library consisting of over 4,000 classes, each with its own functionality, its own limitations, and its own rules for effective use.
**Searching for a term**
You can find things in the API documentation in a number of different ways. Each way is convenient in one situation or another:
+ Using the index.
+ Using the list of classes.

+ I would like to know more about Java and it's syntax.
