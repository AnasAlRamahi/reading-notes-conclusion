#### One-to-One Relationship
Let's define two entity classes Library and Address having a one-to-one relationship, using the @OneToOne annotation. The association is owned by the Library end of the association:

#####  The Data Model:

        @Entity
        public class Library {

            @Id
            @GeneratedValue
            private long id;

            @Column
            private String name;

            @OneToOne
            @JoinColumn(name = "address_id")
            @RestResource(path = "libraryAddress", rel="address")
            private Address address;
            
            // standard constructor, getters, setters
        }


        @Entity
        public class Address {

            @Id
            @GeneratedValue
            private long id;

            @Column(nullable = false)
            private String location;

            @OneToOne(mappedBy = "address")
            private Library library;

            // standard constructor, getters, setters
        }

#### One-to-Many Relationship
A one-to-many relationship is defined using the @OneToMany and @ManyToOne annotations and can have the optional @RestResource annotation to customize the association resource.

#####  The Data Model:

        Entity
        public class Book {

            @Id
            @GeneratedValue
            private long id;
            
            @Column(nullable=false)
            private String title;
            
            @ManyToOne
            @JoinColumn(name="library_id")
            private Library library;
            
            // standard constructor, getter, setter
        }

        public class Library {
        
            //...
        
            @OneToMany(mappedBy = "library")
            private List<Book> books;
        
            //...
        
        }


#### Many-to-Many Relationship
A many-to-many relationship is defined using @ManyToMany annotation, to which we can add @RestResource.

#####  The Data Model:

        @Entity
        public class Author {

            @Id
            @GeneratedValue
            private long id;

            @Column(nullable = false)
            private String name;

            @ManyToMany(cascade = CascadeType.ALL)
            @JoinTable(name = "book_author", 
            joinColumns = @JoinColumn(name = "book_id", referencedColumnName = "id"), 
            inverseJoinColumns = @JoinColumn(name = "author_id", 
            referencedColumnName = "id"))
            private List<Book> books;

            //standard constructors, getters, setters
        }


        public class Book {
        
            //...
        
            @ManyToMany(mappedBy = "books")
            private List<Author> authors;
        
            //...
        }


### **Baeldung: Spring Integration Testing**
Spring Integration Testing verifies the end-to-end behavior of a system.

##### Test: Verify View Name
        @Test
        public void givenHomePageURI_whenMockMVC_thenReturnsIndexJSPViewName() {
            this.mockMvc.perform(get("/homePage")).andDo(print())
            .andExpect(view().name("index"));
        }

**Let's break it down:**

+ perform() method will call a GET request method, which returns the ResultActions. Using this result, we can have assertion expectations about the response, like its content, HTTP status, or header
+ andDo(print()) will print the request and response. This is helpful to get a detailed view in case of an error
+ andExpect() will expect the provided argument. In our case, we're expecting “index” to be returned via MockMvcResultMatchers.view()
