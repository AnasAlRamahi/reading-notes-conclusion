### **HTML Chapter 16: Images**
When you put an image on the page, you will need to adjust its width and height, and then you might think of aligning it. For that there is several technics that you could use to align an image. There are 2 common ways to do so: 
+ Using float property to set it to the left or to the right.
+ Defining them as block-element and then use the text-align property to set it to the left, right, or center.
+ You can also use ``` margin: auto; ``` to keep it in the center as well.

As for **background images**, there are some properties you can use to adjust the background of your page:
+ background-repeat.
+ background-attachment.
+ background-position.

*It is preferred to use a low contrast background, so it is easier for the user to read the content. You can use a tranparent between the background and the content in order to solve that issue as well*.
