### **JavaScript Chapter 3: Object Literals**
**Objects** group together a set of variables and functions to create a model of something you would recognize from the real world. They consist of properties and methods. Properties act as variables, and methods act as functions, but they take different names inside an object.
variables and named functions have name and value, the name is called **key**. Properties are seperated with comas, not semicolons. To *access* properties and methods within an object, you put the object's name, dot and then the property/method name. You can also put the object's name and then square brackets, and inside them put the property's name, but this way only works with properties not with methods.
