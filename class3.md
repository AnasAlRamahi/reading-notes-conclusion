## **Lab 03a:**

##### What I learned from this project:
    I have learned so much through out the course, but through this project sfecifically, I was able to implement all the knowledge I got through the lecture, and understand it much better.
    
    Now I'm able to make my own static website for free on GitHub. And I can share whatever I want with the world in a very simple and easy way, without the need to know how to code with HTML or any other language. You just have to practice for a few hours on Markdown, and then you are set!

    In Addition, Git and GitHub are making developers' lives so much easier with the features they provide. It will save backups to your work, it will host it for free and you can make branches to finish the project in a non-linear way, and then you can push these updates back to the main branch.

This field is so huge and this is only the beginning of the journey and there is still alot more to learn.
