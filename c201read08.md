### **HTML/CSS Chapter 15: Layout**
CSS provide alot of Layout options to position elements to control where each element sits on a page.

In the **normal flow** (static position), each block element appears on a new line, placing in a vertical perspective.

**Relative positioning** can move an element top, right, left and right from the position iT would normally be in in the normal flow. But it reserves it's position in the normal flow not the space of the new position, which can cause elements to overlap.

**Absolute positioning** positions the element in relation to its containing element (direct parent) if the containing element had a relative position. But it will be taken out of the normal flow, meaning that it won't reserve space nor it would affect the position of other elements.

Another type of layout is the **Fixed positioning**, which is the same as absolute positioning, but it's position refers to the browser window, so when you scroll down the window, the element will stay in the same position.

**Floating elements** allows you to take that element out of normal flow and position it to the far left or right of a containing box. The floated element becomes a block-level element around which other content can flow.

*note that: whenever you move any element from the normal flow, boxes can overlap. You can use the z-index property to control which element to appear on top.*
