### **HTML Chapter 3: Lists**
There are three types of lists in HTML:
* Ordered lists
    ``` 
        <ol>
            <li></li>
            <li></li>
        </ol> ```
* Unordered lists
    ``` 
        <ul>
            <li></li>
            <li></li>
        </ul> 
    ```
* Definition lists
    ``` 
        <dl>
            <dt></dt>
            <dd></dd>
            <dt></dt>
            <dd></dd>
        </dl> 
    ```
*keep in mind that lists can be nested in each other*


**HTML Chapter 13: Boxes**
There is alot of properties to control the dimenstions of boxes in HTML, width and height properties will set the dimenstion for the place that the content will be in.
If the height was not enough, the content will appear off of the box and is going to cause alot of mess in the page, and for that you have a property called overflow which takes one of two values: scroll or hidden.

In order to control the height and width so they don't get messy on smaller windows or in larger windows, you can use the min-width, maxx-width, min-height, max-height properties.

Padding poperty is respoonsilbe for the extra distance between the content and the border of the box. The margin, on the other hand, is responsible for the distnce between the border and other boxes. Note that the padding and the margin are extra dimensions that are added to the width and the height.

As for borders, there are properties to control it, such properties: border-width, border-style, border-color, border-radius. The last one is to change the radius of the border corners so you can make different shapes, or mainly to make circled corners for the border.

The display property allows you to turn an inline element into a block-level element or vice versa. It can have one of those four values: inline, block, inline-block, none.
