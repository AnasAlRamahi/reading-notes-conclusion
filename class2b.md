### GitHub as DVCS :

      One of the cool features that GitHub was built for, is the ability to save snapshots of every new version of the project. You just have to edit the page and then it is the modified stage, and then commit the changes. it goes through the staged stage (which means that the site is taking the snapshot of the modified version), and when it goes live, it is now committed (last stage is the commit stage). And on your live URL, you will able to see the new changes, and if something went wrong, you can just go back to the previous commits and return to the previous version.

 

      A DVCS is a Distributed Version Control System, which can save previous versions on your local server, and having a reference to it on a dedicated server. Each time you need to go back to a previous version or you lose data, you simply just go back through the reference, to then reverse back to the previous version. 

 

      This feature was introduced firstly by a DVCS called BitKeeper in 2002. Linux developers used it until they went on a disagreement, and then the chief developer of Linux, Linus Torvalds made the decision to make their own DVCS which is Git. And they included a new concept which is the branches. Other teams working on the project can make a new branch of snapshots. If they finished the adjustment, they can add it back to the main branch. A great concept for co-operating with your teammates and colleagues. You can also push the changes to from the local branch to another remote repository.
