### **HTML: Introduction**



### **HTML Chapter 1: Structure**



### **HTML Chapter 8: Extra Markup**

Use **DOCTYPES** to tell browsers which version of HTML you are using. Also, you can use \<!-- \--> to add comments that won't be shown on the browser, but inside the source. 

The \<div\> tag is a grouping element that allows you to group block-level, and \<span\> allows you to group elements inline.

\<iframe\> is used to add a a window of another page in your website's own page in an image fashion. And the \<meta\> tag allows you to apply kinds of information about your web page. Note that it has 2 attributes that are paired together, name and content. And in some cases, instead of name you can write http-equiv attribute. Each one has a different purpose.

To include some characters that are reserved in Html, or Mathematical/Chemical characters, or any other character, you can use the **Escape characters**.

That's the end of the conclusion. I hope you like it.



### **HTML Chapter 17: HTML Layout**

Describing the main layout of HTML, and then reviewing it from the old HTML version, which depended on the div tag to make the page's structure.
But in the new version of HTML, HTML5, alot of grouping tags were added, mentioned in the list below:

* \<header\> and \<footer\>
* \<nav\>
* \<article\>
* \<aside\>
* \<section\>
* \<hgroup\>
* \<figure\> and \<figcaption\>
*and the one from older version, \<div\> is used in implicit definitions:*
* \<div\>


*To make HTML5 elements work in Internet Explorer 8
(and older versions of IE), extra JavaScript is needed,
which is available free from Google.*


### **HTML Chapter 18: Process & Design**

As you develop your website, you have to care about what your audience truely is. You better look up some **stats** about the community you're targetting with your website. Status like *age*, *goals*, *achievments* are helpful.

You can use some concepts to help you make a visual idea of what the site is going to be like. Such tools are **Site Maps** and **Wire Frames**.

Make your design in a **visual Hierarchy** fashion. Because Design is all about communication. Try to manipulate *Color*, *Size* and *Style*. You can also use **Grouping** and **Similarity** to make it easier to the user to understand you. 


### **Javascript: Introduction**
**Javascript** is a programming language that allows the user to make the HTML page interactive and dynamic. You write scripts on your page, and the script will tell the browser exactly what to do, the browser will read it like a cooking recipe, step by step.

Computers doesn't act like humans, they will do the task (the script) every time as it is the first time it does it, unlike humans, it will be hard from them on the first time and then they get used to doing that task.

When you want to write a script, it is recommended to draw a flowchart to how the script is actually going to work, step by step.
