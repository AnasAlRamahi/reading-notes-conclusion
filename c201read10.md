### **JavaScript Chapter 10: Error Handling & Debugging**
JavaScript interpreter accesses one statement line at a time. When a satatement need information from another function, it **stacks** the new function of top of the old one, then it keeps doing that until it reaches the return statement, which brings the interpreter to the previous calling code. 

There is one **global context**, and every function has its own **function context**, meaning, variables and methods inside a function are known written inside the function context and won't be seen the global context.

When we create a function in JavaScript, a concept of **hoisting** will happen. Hoisting is the process of creating the function's scope, and it's variables, functions and methods, which makes it possible to call a function before it is declared, because it was prepared when the hoisting happened. After that comes the execution.

There are different approaches to fix bugs in JavaScript, you can use the error objects that appear in the console, or you can use the console logs to log some information in order to conclude what went wrong with the code, or you can use something called debugging, by putting breaking points at lines and check all the values until that line was processed. You can also use the try catch , to fix them if certain situation occured.
