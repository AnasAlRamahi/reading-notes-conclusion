***GitHub*** is providing markdown. Which is a text format that gives you a variety of options, like formatting text to italic or bold, or writing links, quotes, lists and so on. You can even use the ```  this content will appear inside a box  ``` to add content inside boxes. And you can ignore the markdown by writing / before the markdown character.



***GitHub*** Pages can serve your projects or repositories, without the need to set up the database or configure the server, through you personal GitHub URL. And with the help of Jekyll that transform plain text files into websites. You can publish customize with some built in themes, and then add content using Markdown. And then you can publish it to share it to the world.
