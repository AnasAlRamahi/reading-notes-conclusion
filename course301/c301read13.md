### **Status Codes Based On REST Methods:**
#### **In your own words, describe what each group of status code represents:**
100’s = These are informational status codes.
200’s = These are the success codes.
300’s = These are redirection codes.
400’s = These are the client error codes.
500’s = These are the server error codes.


#### **What is a status code 202?**
Often used for asynchronous processing. This code tells the client that the request was valid, but its processing will finish sometime in the future.

#### **What is a status code 308?**
This is the right code if the resource will now be available at a new URL and the client should directly access it via the new URL in the future.

#### **What code would you use if an update didn’t return data to a client?**
**204**

#### **What code would you use if a resource used to exist but no longer does?**
**410**

#### **What is the ‘Forbidden’ status code?**
The client has authorized or doesn’t need to authorize itself, but still has no permissions to access the resource.
