### **React Docs: Lists & Keys**
#### **What does .map() return?**
It return an new array with changes but with the same length.

#### **If I want to loop through an array and display each value in JSX, how do I do that in React?**
We loop throught them using the .map() array method.

#### **Each list item needs a unique ____.**
Key.

#### **What is the purpose of a key?**
Keys help React identify which items have changed, are added, or are removed. Keys should be given to the elements inside the array to give the elements a stable identity.


### **The spread operator:**
#### **What is the spread operator?**
JavaScript's spread syntax refers to the use of an ellipsis of three dots (…) to expand an iterable object into the list of arguments.

#### **List 4 things that the spread operator can do.**
1. Copying an array.
2. Concatenating or combining arrays.
3. Using Math functions.
4. Using an array as argument.

#### **Give an example of using the spread operator to combine two arrays.**
    const myArray = [`🤪`,`🐻`,`🎌`]
    const yourArray = [`🙂`,`🤗`,`🤩`]
    const ourArray = [...myArray,...yourArray]
    console.log(...ourArray) // 🤪 🐻 🎌 🙂 🤗 🤩

#### **Give an example of using the spread operator to add a new item to an array.**
    const fewFruit = ['🍏','🍊','🍌']
    const fewMoreFruit = ['🍉', '🍍', ...fewFruit]
    console.log(fewMoreFruit) //  Array(5) [ "🍉", "🍍", "🍏", "🍊", "🍌" ]

#### **Give an example of using the spread operator to combine two objects into one.**
    const objectOne = {hello: "🤪"}
    const objectTwo = {world: "🐻"}
    const objectThree = {...objectOne, ...objectTwo, laugh: "😂"}
    console.log(objectThree) // Object { hello: "🤪", world: "🐻", laugh: "😂" }
    const objectFour = {...objectOne, ...objectTwo, laugh: () => {console.log("😂".repeat(5))}}
    objectFour.laugh() // 😂😂😂😂😂


### **How to Pass Functions Between Components:**
#### **In the video, what is the first step that the developer does to pass functions between components?**
Create a function in the parent component.

#### **In your own words, what does the increment function do?**
It increments the count variablie which was also passed from the parent to the child by one.

#### **How can you pass a method from a parent component into a child component?**
By sending it as a prop, and in the child component you can call inside another function.

#### **How does the child component invoke a method that was passed to it from a parent component?**
It invokes the method inside a method written inside of it, and if a parameter was a passed prop, you can call it using this.props.nameofprop as an argument.



## Things I want to know more about
+ Know more about the spread opartors and how to use them effeciently.
+ Getting used to passing functions and states from a component to its child.
