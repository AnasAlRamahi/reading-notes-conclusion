## **Course 301: Read 08**


### **Understanding the JavaScript Call Stack:**
#### **What is a ‘call’?**
call stack is a data structure that uses the Last In, First Out (LIFO) principle to temporarily store and manage function invocation (call).

#### **How many ‘calls’ can happen at once?**
It is single-threaded. Meaning it can only do one thing at a time.

#### **What does LIFO mean?**
Last In, First Out, which basically means that the last function that gets pushed into the stack is the first to be pop out, when the function returns.

#### **Draw an example of a call stack and the functions that would need to be invoked to generate that call stack.**

    function firstFunction(){
    console.log("Hello from firstFunction");
    }

    function secondFunction(){
    firstFunction();
    console.log("The end from secondFunction");
    }

    secondFunction();

This is what happens when the code is run:
1. When secondFunction() gets executed, an empty stack frame is created. It is the main (anonymous) entry point of the program.
2. secondFunction() then calls firstFunction()which is pushed into the stack.
3. firstFunction() returns and prints “Hello from firstFunction” to the console.
4. firstFunction() is pop off the stack.
5. The execution order then move to secondFunction().
6. secondFunction() returns and print “The end from secondFunction” to the console.
7. secondFunction() is pop off the stack, clearing the memory.

#### **What causes a Stack Overflow?**
A stack overflow occurs when there is a recursive function (a function that calls itself) without an exit point.

### **JavaScript error messages:**
#### **What is a ‘refrence error’?**
An error that pops when you try to use a variable that is not yet declared. It can be solved by declaring the variable before it is used.

#### **What is a ‘syntax error’?**
This error occurs when you have something that cannot be parsed in terms of syntax. It can be solved by simply fixing the syntax.

#### **What is a ‘range error’?**
The RangeError object indicates an error when a value is not in the set or range of allowed values.

#### **What is a ‘type error’?**
this types of errors show up when the types (number, string and so on) you are trying to use or access are incompatible. To fix it, just make sure that the type exists before trying to access it, either by creating it or by checking for undefined.

#### **What is a breakpoint?**
It is used when debugging, it stops the compiler at a certain line, giving the values for all the variables, in order to fix a bug in the application.

#### **What does the word ‘debugger’ do in your code?**
A debugger is a software tool that can help the software development process by identifying coding errors at various stages of the operating system or application development. Some debuggers will analyze a test run to see what lines of code were not executed.
