## **Course 301: Read 07**


### **How I explained REST to my brother:**
#### **Who is Roy Fielding?**
He is a bright developer, who built the HTTP protocol, which made the internet that we use everyday.

#### **Why donâ€™t the techniques that we use today work well when we need to be able to talk to all of the machines in the world?**
Because it wasn't designed to do so when Roy Fielding and his friends created the HTTP protocol, his prime concern was to make some machines talk with each other, not all of them.

#### **What is the HTTP protocol that Fielding and his friends created?**
It is all about verbs(actions), that can be applied to nouns(webpages). For example: GET, which gets you resources on the web through the HTTP protocol. 

#### **What does a GET do?**
It gets you resources over the web.

#### **What does a POST do?**
If one system wants to add something to another system.

#### **What does PUT do?**
If a system wants to replace something in another system.

#### **What does PATCH do?**
Do a partial update.


## Things I want to know more about
+ How HTTP differs from other protocols, and how protocols actually work.
+ Networks and how the World Wide Web actually works.
